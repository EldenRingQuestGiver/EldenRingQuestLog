# Elden Ring Merchant Mod

A mod for Elden Ring that allows all items to be acquired for free, to quickly make builds.

This is essentially a clone of [Grand Merchant](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/129).
However, it's implemented as a DLL mod, which has several advantages:

- It can be used along with other mods that change files such as `regulation.bin` without merging
- It should be compatible with future game updates
- It can be used to acquire new items added in overhaul mods

See [the NexusMods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5192) for installation, usage, and full credits.
