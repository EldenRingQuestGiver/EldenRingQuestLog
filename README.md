# Elden Ring Quest Log

A mod for Elden Ring that allows to check on the progress for all quests done so far.

Implemented as a DLL mod, which has several advantages:

- It can be used along with other mods that change files such as `regulation.bin` without merging
- It should be compatible with future game updates
- It can be used to acquire new items added in overhaul mods

Full credits for the original code and the help to make this mod go to Tom Clark, the original creator of the Glorious Merchant mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5192).
